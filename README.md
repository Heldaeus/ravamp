A Ravenfield ReShade preset designed to revamp the appearance of default maps and more!

## Description

I designed this preset with the intention of maturing the in-game appearance of Ravenfield. There is nothing but love for the game here but I’m sure we can all agree the default appearance has… *quirks*. This config, in my opinion, ameliorates these quirks, makes the base game far more enjoyable to play and less visually fatiguing.

#### Warning

This is a relatively hefty preset with 14 total shaders being applied. Performance may vary from machine to machine.

## Help

If the specular highlights are too bright or muted you can adjust this easily with the ‘PD80_03_Shadows_Midtones_Highlights.fx’ shader. Under ‘Highlight Adjustments’ select ‘Color’ and within the color picker dialogue you can adjust the brightness of the sampled color.
