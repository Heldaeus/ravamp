# Ravamp :art:
A Ravenfield ReShade preset designed to revamp the in-game appearance of the default maps!

<br/>

## Description

I designed this preset with the goal of refining the in-game appearance of Ravenfield. There is nothing but love for the game here but I’m sure we can all agree the default appearance has… *quirks*. This config, in my opinion, ameliorates these quirks, makes the base game less visually fatiguing and more enjoyable to play.

My goal is to simply and subjectively enhance Ravenfield while honoring the default vibe of the game.

#### Warning

This is a relatively hefty preset with 14 total shaders being applied! Performance may vary from machine to machine.
