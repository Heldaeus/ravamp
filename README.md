# Ravamp :art:
A Ravenfield ReShade preset designed to revamp the appearance of default maps and more!

![](./Images/hero.jpg)

<br/>

## Description

I designed this preset with the goal of refining the in-game appearance of Ravenfield. There is nothing but love for the game here but I’m sure we can all agree the default appearance has… *quirks*. This config, in my opinion, ameliorates these quirks, makes the base game less visually fatiguing and more enjoyable to play.

#### Warning

This is a relatively hefty preset with 14 total shaders being applied. Performance may vary from machine to machine.
